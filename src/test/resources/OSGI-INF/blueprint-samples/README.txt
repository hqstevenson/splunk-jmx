This directory contains examples of the configuration that could be used to monitor the
JMX MBeans and Attributes that are documented for ActiveMQ ( http://activemq.apache.org/jmx.html ).

Additional JMX MBeans and attributes could be monitored as well - the activemq-broker-attributes.xml blueprint
includes collecting two JMX Attributes for the Broker MBean which are not documented on the ActiveMQ website)
